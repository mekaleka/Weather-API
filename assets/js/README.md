# Weather Dashboard API

This is a Weather Dashboard API that allows the user to input search data for a city they would like to get the weather forecast for. It then displays the forecast for that day. Then the user can also view the five day forecast and be able to save the searched cities for future access. 
 
I created this to challenge my abilities to create something new that I have not tried before. It pushes me to think outside the box and come up with an interactive application that helps busy professionals in the everyday hustle and bustle.
