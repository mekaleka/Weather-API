This is an app that allows the user to input a city into a search field and pull up the current weather. Then the user can also view the five day forecast and save that city for the future. I enjoy making apps like this. By using an api key I am able to access data from around the world to help the user access the data they need. I learned that there is a lot of different types of information available to access and it makes it so developers can be able to create and fine tune projects so the UI has what it needs to meet the user experience's expectations. I look forward to adding to this project in the near future.
