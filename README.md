This is an app that allows the user to input a city into a search field and pull up the current weather. Then the user can also view the five day forecast and save that city for the future. I enjoy making apps like this because people everywhere can use it. By using an api key I am able to access data from around the world to help the user get the data they need. I learned that there is a lot of different types of information available to access and it makes it so developers can be able to create and fine tune projects. Also so the UI has what it needs to meet the users expectations. I look forward to future development with this Weather Tracker.
